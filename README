Wad of Stuff Django Forms
=========================

A set of utility functions and classes to extend the functionality of Django
forms.

Requirements
============

Django 1.0 or newer.

Functions
=========

security_hash(request, form, exclude=None, *args)
-------------------------------------------------

Calculates a security hash for the given Form/FormSet instance.

This creates a list of the form field names/values in a deterministic
order, pickles the result with the SECRET_KEY setting, then takes an md5
hash of that.

Allows a list of form fields to be excluded from the hash calculation. This
is useful form fields that may have their values set programmatically.

Classes
=======

BoundFormWizard
---------------

A subclass of Django's FormWizard that adds the following functionality:

- Renders `previous_fields` as a list of bound form fields in the template
  context rather than as raw html.
- Can handle FormSets.

The usage of this class is identical to that documented at
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/formtools/form-wizard/ with
the exception that when rendering `previous_fields` you should change your
wizard step templates from:

    <input type="hidden" name="{{ step_field }}" value="{{ step0 }}" />
    {{ previous_fields|safe }}

to:

    <input type="hidden" name="{{ step_field }}" value="{{ step0 }}" />
    {% for f in previous_fields %}{{ f.as_hidden }}{% endfor %}
